# Team leader's codex

_A simple guide on how to be a good team leader_

Leading people is a difficult task not only in Applifting; some people are born to be leaders and do not have to do anything for it, while others need more time and some encouragement. In any case, everybody has ample room for improvement. This brief overview presents a map for all those who want to strive at a temaleding position. It is basically a guide for team leaders.

This document is obviously based on the [Applifter's codex](./kodex-appliftera-en.md), so do not proceed with reading this guide before you finish that one first!

## Objectivity - My requirements are realistic and I treat everybody equally

### Work with what you have

It actually happened, you are leading a team of Applifters, which undoubtedly means a team of great people. Knowing the cards you are playing with is essential.
Make a point of knowing the skill factor at your disposition and delegate work accordingly. Be realistic and do not require too much of either a junior or a senior - assign tasks so that everybody feels comfortable they can manage it.

### Be tough but fair

On the other hand, if a deadline was agreed on, demand completion on time; deadlines have to be met, or else a problem must be duly reported (fail fast).

### New people, fresh blood

New people may enter the team, which is always great; however, some of them may not have what it takes, working for Applifting is never a piece of cake. You are the one who has to decide; try to stay unbiased. be fair but do not mince your words. In case of doubts go and talk to a different team leader, a member of the Council, alternately anyone you think can help you make the right decision.

### Make plans and do not take up more than you can handle

We all know it - everybody has overestimated themselves, miscalculated the price estimate or something came up they were not counting with. However, try to pay a lot of attention to analysis and planning, because your fail would mean your whole team's failure this time.
