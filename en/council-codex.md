# Council of Elders Codex

## Why the Council Exists

Applifting doesn't have bosses in the traditional sense. We believe managing people is often counterproductive. Instead, we support each other through guidance, reflection, and shared responsibility.

The Council of Elders exists to make sure this kind of support is always present ‚Äî especially when it comes to our values, our vision, and the way we make big decisions together.

The Council is made up of six Applifters elected by other Applifters. Its members are a cross-section of the company ‚Äî from different teams, roles, and perspectives.

At least one council member is always a company owner, to help ensure that strategic decisions stay in touch with the company's legal obligations.

If no owner is elected, it may signal a disconnect between ownership and the rest of the company. In that case, a mediated discussion will help us explore what's behind it and how to move forward.

## What the Council Does

- Help C-team shape Applifting's strategy and approve it
- Keep our mission, vision and values present in decisions
- Provide guidance to the C-Team and oversee whether the company is staying on course
- Be the last resort in tension and conflict resolution
- Approve major governance topics ‚Äî anything that changes how the company operates at a fundamental level
- Approve long-term investments
- Make sure important decisions are not made in a rush or in isolation

Council members are not here to manage or micromanage. Their role is to listen, reflect, ask hard questions, and be vocal when it matters.

## Relationship with the C-Team

The Council and the C-Team work in close partnership. The C-Team leads the company forward day to day ‚Äî setting goals, making decisions, and helping teams thrive. The Council oversees this work to ensure it stays aligned with Applifting's purpose, values, and long-term direction.

Here's how the collaboration works:

- The Council approves company strategy and can give feedback or request changes.
- The C-Team helps shape the strategy and is responsible for fulfilling it.
- The Council evaluates C-Team goals (C-Goals üåäüïäÔ∏è), ensuring they align with the company's direction.
- The C-Team regularly reports on their work and results.
- If a Council member strongly disagrees with a C-Team decision, they can request a discussion or even propose a veto ‚Äî but the goal is alignment, not control.
- The Council can propose dismissal of the C-Team if needed, and has a vote if Founders disagree.

To avoid any conflict of interest, no one can be a member of both the Council and the C-Team at the same time.

The Council is not a manager of the C-Team, but it is a strategic partner and ethical compass. Trust, transparency, and regular communication keep this relationship healthy.

## How the Council Works

- Council meets every two weeks. Any Applifter can attend, listen in, or ask for a topic to be added to the agenda (todo link to section for applifters).
- Meetings are public unless the topic is sensitive ‚Äî for example, when it concerns personal conflict, emotionally charged issues or confidential matters.
- Complex discussions that require a lot of context and would be hard to explain on the spot can be also discussed in private. In such case, the decision must still be presented publicly afterward.
- Council decisions are made by consent ‚Äî at least half of the members must actively support a proposal, and no one should have strong, unresolved objections.

## Being a Council Member

You were chosen because people trust your judgment. That trust doesn't mean you need to have all the answers ‚Äî but it does mean you're expected to hold space for what matters. Your role is to see the big picture, name the tensions others avoid, and protect the values that make Applifting what it is.

You are not a manager, you are a guardian. That means:

- Asking the uncomfortable but necessary questions
- Helping others feel safe bringing hard topics to the surface
- Looking for the long-term impact, not only short-term efficiency
- Being transparent about your own uncertainty ‚Äî and asking for help when you need it
- Staying calm when others are overwhelmed

You're also a partner to the C-Team. They lead the company forward day to day, and your role is to support them, challenge them thoughtfully, and help them see angles they might miss. Be generous with your perspective, and be precise when something feels off. You're not here to second-guess, but to add strategic clarity and moral grounding.

You are here to help the company grow without losing itself.

Being in the Council can feel lonely sometimes ‚Äî the topics are weighty, the discussions long, and the right answers are rarely obvious. But you're not alone. Your fellow Council members are with you. And the Applifters who elected you want you to succeed. Ask them for their thoughts. Let them know you're thinking on their behalf. That's what this role is really about.

Sometimes you might feel pressure to decide right away. And sometimes, things really are urgent. But even then, take a breath. The Council is not here to rush decisions ‚Äî it's here to help the company make good ones. Make sure you understand the context, ask questions, and talk to the people involved.

## What the Council Is Not

- A boss
- A blocker
- A fast lane to council members' initiatives

The Council has no mandate to tell others what to do. It doesn't assign tasks, enforce delivery, or command teams. Instead, it stewards culture and alignment, offering guidance, questions, and feedback ‚Äî not instructions.

It's also not a place to shortcut your own ideas. Council members often care deeply about Applifting and have strong opinions ‚Äî that's part of why they were elected. But being in the Council doesn't give you extra influence over what gets prioritized. In fact, you'll likely have *less* time to move your personal initiatives forward, because you're there to listen, weigh trade-offs, and support others.

If you have something you want to drive forward, the best place to lead it from is often outside the Council ‚Äî where you can act with more speed, focus, and freedom.

The Council isn't here to lead from the front or rule from above. It's here to protect the foundation so others can build on it.

## If you're an Applifter

You don't need permission to care about something ‚Äî or to act on it. The Council exists so that no one feels alone with a tough topic, a big idea, or a feeling that something's off.

If you're struggling to resolve a tension, or if something feels too complex or sensitive to bring up casually, you can approach any Council member. They're here to listen ‚Äî not to judge or delegate ‚Äî but to help you think it through. You can also propose a topic for the Council agenda, even if you're not sure what the solution should be. (todo add link how to)

That said, it's important to respect responsibilities. If someone is accountable for an area, they are empowered to make decisions there. The Council is not a backdoor to override those decisions through public pressure or indirect escalation. If you disagree with a decision, start by talking directly to the person responsible ‚Äî not because you can't raise it, but because it's the most respectful and effective way forward. If things still feel unresolved, the Council can help create clarity or facilitate dialogue ‚Äî but not take over someone else's responsibility.

And if you're just curious? Show up. Council meetings are open. Listening in is a great way to understand what's going on and how the company steers itself over time. After each Council meeting, a summary of the decisions is shared in Slack, so even if you can't join, you can still stay in the loop.

## Final Word

The Council is a safeguard. A compass. A quiet presence that helps us slow down and reflect when we need it most. It works when we trust it, question it, and take part in it. Council doesn't chart the path ‚Äî but it helps us stay oriented to what really matters.

The Council is here for all of us. It's a tool. Use it.
