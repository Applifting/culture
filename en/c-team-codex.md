# C-Team Codex

The C-Team in Applifting is a group of dedicated leaders who guide the company's direction and embody our core values. They ensure Applifting runs smoothly, grows sustainably, and stays true to its teal principles. By living the ideals in this codex, the C-Team drives Applifting towards its mission of creating digital products with positive impact on planetary scale.

## Lead with Vision, Not Control

### Trust in the Teal culture

Teal culture is built on three fundamental principles:

1. **Authenticity and Self-Expression**: Be your authentic self and create space for others to do the same. Leadership in a teal organization means removing masks and encouraging genuine self-expression at all levels.

2. **Self-Management and Empowerment**: Rather than taking responsibility for others, empower them to take responsibility for themselves. Your role is to create conditions where people can grow, make decisions, and own their outcomes. Guide and mentor, but avoid solving problems that others should solve themselves.

3. **Evolutionary Purpose**: Stay attuned to how the organization and its environment are evolving. Adapt and respond to changes organically, letting the organization's purpose guide decision-making rather than rigid control structures.

Lead by setting a clear direction, not by micromanaging. Make sure Applifting integrates all levels of our goals - health of the company, our wellbeing goals and our vision of positive planetary impact.

Value each person's contribution, regardless of title or status. Every voice in the organization is important.

### Freedom with Responsibility

The C-Team has full freedom to explore innovative solutions, provided they respect Applifting's values and aim to make our collective vision a reality.

### Collaborate with the Council of Elders

Before implementing significant changes, consult and collaborate with the Council of Elders. Discuss major decisions openly, seeking their input and guidance. Remember that the Council of Elders has veto power over C-Team's decisions - but the best veto power is the one which never has to be used.

## Lead by example

First and foremost, be an example for other Applifters. Live by the Applifter's codex.

### Be an Ambassador

Externally, be an ambassador of Applifting's values. Communicate openly with customers and partners, ensuring your actions align with the values of transparency and authenticity.

### Sincerity in Communication

Always speak the truth and ensure honesty in every interaction, whether with team members, partners, or clients.

### Own Your Failures, Share Your Successes

Be accountable for both your successes and failures. Celebrate wins openly, but donâ€™t shy away from admitting mistakes and learning from them. Vulnerability is strength. Be open to feedback from anyone in the organization, regardless of their role.

### Foster Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

Understanding the perspectives and emotions of others is essential. Lead with emotional intelligence, creating an environment where people feel seen and understood. Actively avoid and discourage toxic behaviors.

### Preserve our Culture of Joy and Fulfillment

Leadership is not only about success but also about joy. It is your role to maintain a space where people enjoy their work. Embrace a fun, informal culture where people can be themselves.
