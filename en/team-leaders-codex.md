# Team leader's codex

_A simple guide on how to be a good team leader_

Leading people is a difficult task not only in Applifting; some people are born to be leaders and do not have to do anything for it, while others need more time and some encouragement. In any case, everybody has ample room for improvement. This brief overview presents a map for all those who want to strive at a temleading position. It is basically a guide for team leaders.

This document is obviously based on the [Applifter's codex](./kodex-appliftera-en.md), so do not proceed with reading this guide before you finish that one first!

## Objectivity - My requirements are realistic and I treat everybody equally

### Work with what you have

It actually happened, you are leading a team of Applifters, which undoubtedly means a team of great people. Knowing the cards you are playing with is essential.
Make a point of knowing the skill factor at your disposition and delegate work accordingly. Be realistic and do not require too much of either a junior or a senior - assign tasks so that everybody feels comfortable they can manage it.

### Be tough but fair

On the other hand, if a deadline was agreed on, demand completion on time; deadlines have to be met, or else a problem must be duly reported (fail fast).

### New people, fresh blood

New people may enter the team, which is always great; however, some of them may not have what it takes, working for Applifting is never a piece of cake. You are the one who has to decide; try to stay unbiased, be fair but do not mince your words. In case of doubts go and talk to a different team leader, a member of the Council, alternately anyone you think can help you make the right decision.

### Make plans and do not take up more than you can handle

We all know it - everybody has overestimated themselves, miscalculated the price estimate or something came up they were not counting with. However, try to pay a lot of attention to analysis and planning, because your fail would mean your whole team's failure this time.

## Education - it is in my interest that my team improve their skills

### Lead people forward

I make sure people on my team each have their own mentor and so are able to acquire more experience. I consult their skills and soft skills with the mentor, alternately we set goals together so that our colleague gets better by the day.

## Ego aside - be a model leader, do not look down on your team

### Be helpful and on hand

Your objective is not to drown your team in unreasonable requirements; as soon as you notice someone having a problem they have been struggling with for too long, go and help them get things done. Do not, however, try to help them prematurely; let people do things their own way first, let them know you believe in them! In short, act so that everybody has a chance to improve their skills.

### Be responsible

Team leading involves enjoyable success as well as failures. We all know it - when things go wrong, they do so in earnest. In those times, do not blame others; on the contrary, stand by your team. Show your face, apologize to the customer and attempt to find the cause which you can then discuss with the team. Set a procedure for everybody to avoid future failures.

### Not knowing is OK - Admit it and find a solution with the team

Do not be afraid to say so, nobody is perfect. Tell your team you are not sure; most importantly, do not obscure. Get up and find out what needs to be done. You do not have to be alone in solving the problem. Discuss the essential matters with the whole team whereas the individual task can be handled by you or be delegated to other team members.

## You are an Applifting's frontman - find the ambassador in you

### Communication with the customer

At times you will need to consult the customer. Try to judge the situation and act accordingly so as not to shame yourself or Applifting. Do not dissemble, we each have our own identity. When we say "ambassador", we do not mean a populist but a decent person, with a knack for communication.

### Internal, team communication

You are responsible for the team, so try to manage internal communication as well. At times you must conduct standups, status meetings or, for instance, debates. Keeping it to a certain standard is a good idea - both in terms of knowledge and formality.
