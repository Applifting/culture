## What is (and what isn't) a feedback

We all know the term "feedback", but what is its meaning in the context of our culture? In our DNA is the desire to develop and improve not only our surroundings, but also ourselves. Feedback is our guide to that improvement, so we encourage sharing it across the company. Open communication and a safe environment in which we are not afraid to share our opinions are a recognised value at our company and everyone's daily actions are aimed at cultivating this. That's why we actively solicit feedback and willingly provide it to others.

Feedback:

* is a way of developing yourself and others;
* is a way out of our own dissatisfaction/discomfort;
* is a way to influence our environment;
* is a communication of how we perceive the behaviour of others;
* is based on honesty, trust and seeking to understand;
* is part of an agile approach to work;
* improves teamwork;
* helps to clarify reality and eliminates (mis)assumptions;
* is not negative nitpicking or criticism;
* not just a hateful remark that diminishes someone's person or work.

# When I give feedback

In our concept, feedback is a method of development, so it should primarily help the receiver (not the one giving it). It is the responsibility of the giver of feedback to give it in a way that the receiver can understand the message. This requires the ability to name behaviours and feelings. Confrontation is not avoided and shows concern for the other - the goal is to help the other, not to criticize them.

Beware of destructive empathy! Sometimes it happens that we are faced with the decision of whether or not to give feedback, and in the end we decide not to do so in order not to hurt the other person. This is called a **destructive empathy** and it is the fear of giving feedback in order not to hurt others. In reality, the tendency is not to protect others, but to protect ourselves and not to expose ourselves to the unpleasant confrontation. The result, however, is standing idly by in a situation which we could improve by our actions.

## How to formulate feedback - general principles

**Objective:** We want to deepen the understanding of the person being evaluated, his/her strengths and weaknesses and personal development, which forms the basis for further improvement of work performance

**Clarity, intelligibility, specificity:** keep in mind that feedback is distorted by noise caused by interpersonal communication (e.g. tone of voice, non-verbal communication, [attribution errors](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%A1kladn%C3%AD_atribu%C4%8Dn%C3%AD_chyba) etc.). Your communication still needs to be clear enough and straightforward, not vague. Giving specific examples will help you to do this.

**What can be changed:** we give feedback on observable behaviours, not on human personality parameters and other characteristics that we cannot change (e.g. I don't tell a person that he is untimely), but I can give him feedback on the fact that he was repeatedly late.

**"I" form:** I give feedback knowing that it is my subjective opinion, not the objective truth.We give it on what we have direct experience of and phrase it relative to our person (e.g., I feel disappointed about this, not you disappointed me).

**Future orientation:** we don't want to dwell on the past, we are all about learning for the future.

**Emotional calm:** our task is not to cloud the feedback with emotions on both sides. Vagueness of message and inadequate emotional charge are the most common mistakes on the giver's side, avoid it by calming down before the meeting and setting the whole atmosphere of the meeting on a friendly note.

**Space for questions or reactions:** the recipient of feedback may be surprised or experiencing a variety of feelings, so listen and give them space to share them.

## Feedback formulation method

If you are feeling uncertain about what to say and how to say it, this model will help:

**Behavior-Impact-Options (BIO) model**

**[B]Behavior** - description of fact

* Describe the situation and visible behavior without judgments; 
* stick to the facts only; 
* do not describe the colleague as such, only the behaviour you saw.

**[I] Impact** - the consequence of the behaviour

* describe your feelings about the behaviour and what you think about it; 
* share sensitively and openly and speak for yourself.

**[O] Option** - possible alternatives

* add recommendations on what would be great to do differently next time and what can be worked on now;
* recommendations should be specific, measurable;
* may include a description of the expected effect, i.e. what the person will gain by changing the behaviour.

## How to prepare for giving feedback

Preparation is the key to ensuring that our feedback has the desired effect. How to proceed when you have received a request from a colleague to share feedback or want to give it on your own initiative:

1. **Gather data for your goal** - be clear about what you want to give feedback on and gather specific data to support your feedback (examples from observations, events, work results, etc.).
2. **Write it down** - some people just need notes, others a mind map, some prefer to prepare full sentences. Find your style and formulate your feedback. The BIO model (see above) will help you with the formulation.
3. **Don't delay** - schedule a time in your calendar when the feedback will be delivered.
4. **Create a welcoming environment** - each type of feedback requires its own environment, trivial feedback can be communicated on a walk or in a meeting, but the more serious the topic, the more important it is to create a private and safe space to share and receive it. The general golden rule is that we praise publicly and communicate unpleasant criticism privately (see the Applifter's Codex).
5. **Adhere to the principles of giving feedback mentioned above.**
6. **Say thanks** - end the meeting in a positive way, thanking the other person for their openness and desire to develop, offering support and discussing next steps so that we don't leave the other person feeling confused, but rather that they know what they can work on.

*ðŸ’¡ Feedback and open communication are key to the personal development of each of us and the company as a whole. Unfortunately, we don't naturally know how to give it properly. The good news is that it can be learned. If you feel that you should and would like to work on your ability to give effective and growth-producing feedback, reach out to your mentor or HR to connect you with a coach.*
