*Simple guide how to be a good Applifter*

Hi there, we are glad you've decided to be one of us. We hope we won't disappoint you and that you'll find Applifting to be a nice company to work for. You are going to find a few guiding principles that will help you to have a positive work experience. If you follow these simple principles, other Applifters will love working with you.

## Basic assumptions

Our company culture is built on the following basic assumptions:

* Applifters are good and fair people
* Applifters are motivated to bring value to others
* Applifters want to take responsibility for things that matter to them. (They also appreciate the appreciation, respect, and decision power that comes with it)

## Sincerity - I say things how they are

### "Hey bro!" culture

We are informal with each other.  Important is what you can do and how it like to be working with you. 
(On the other hand, it is not important how you look, what is your past and whether you are a girl or a guy). We work together and most of us like to meet other Applifters in personal life. 

One of the main reasons we hired you is that we think you will be a good fit for our culture.  If you find out you do not like working with us, no big deal. Just say it. This is why we have a probation period in the work contract :-).  

### If I don't like something, I say it

It is important to speak to other Applifters about things you do not like. Ideally, talk directly to the person that can do something about it. 

If you have a conflict with another Applifter, do not hold it in. First, try to resolve it in private between the two of you. If this fails, find a colleague you both trust to help you resolve the situation.

 Only with honesty and sincerity will we be able to keep Applifting the place where it is a joy to be working and where we can talk openly.

## Trust - I keep my promises

### I only make promises I intend to keep

If I make a promise to fellow Applifter, to a customer or to a partner, I always try to keep them. It is important that others can rely on you. It is always better to not to give a promise than to give one you think you will not be able to keep. Learn to say no or learn to specify conditions under which you are able to deliver on your promise.

Signal failure to keep your promise in advance. (Fail fast.)

Do not be afraid to ask for help or advice.

## Freedom 
**I work how much I want, where I want and when I want while respecting the agreements I made with my team members**

### I work how much I want
When you start a full-time position in Applifting, we expect you will be working 7-8 hours a day. It's easy to change that. If you want to work less or more than that, just go to your team leader and come to an arrangement that will fit you and your team.

There might come a time when we as a team need to buckle up and do extra work to meet the deadlines. Sometimes you can tell yourself that this is the situation where extra effort is needed and sometimes you will be asked by your colleagues to put some extra work. 

We greatly appreciate it if you help us in those times. Let us know If you work overtime regularly! These should be exceptional situations.  Not that your overtime wouldn't not be rewarded: your extra time is always paid by your standard rate. Nonetheless, we would be devastated if you would burn out because of constant crunch time.

Some people literally breathe for Applifting. (Vr치콘a, Filip, and others ;-) ) Those guys and gals regularly work more than 8 hours per day; sometimes because they really enjoy it, sometimes because it is needed and they want to spare some other Applifter from overtime. Nobody asks you to be that involved. It is completely alright to work 7-8 hours and then go home. We respect that for some Applifters there is a strict divide between work and free time.


### I work where I want and when I want, but only if I have what it takes

We preferred to work together in one place and during roughly the same work hours. (That's the way we enjoy our work most!) But in the end, we do not care if you do your work early in the morning, at midnight or during normal work hours. We just need you to be able to coordinate the effort with others. Talk to your team about what are their expectations. Ask them what kind of work you can do alone and what are the tasks that are better to be done together with a team.

Your freedom in this matter goes hand in hand with your maturity. If you are effective and deliver on your promises while being remote, it is not a problem. We would gladly work with you even if you were in Japan. :)

## Craftmanship - I strive to be pro in my field. 

**I do things as best as I possibly can. I continually work on my improvement.**

I know standards and best practices in my field. I perform my craft according to them.  I do not make compromises in things that matter. If I am asked by a customer or by a fellow Applifter to cut corners, I make sure he/she knows what is being asked. Defend the honest and proper way of doing things If you are asked to take shortcuts in an essential matter ( security, performance of critical application part, UX of key functionality...). Defend it even if it means to challenge other Applifter or a customer.

Seek knowledge proactively If you have a feeling that you do not completely know the best practices in your field. It's always a good idea to consult more experienced Applifter.

### I want to be good and I do something for it.

*"Learn or die"*

I constantly work on myself and my craftsmanship. I keep up with trends. I am not afraid to go beyond my main profession to expand my horizons in order to better cooperate with my colleagues. (Front-end dev can learn something about backend and graphic can learn how to prepare assets for mobile developers)

### I want to share what I know with others

*"Teach or die"*

I am proud of my skill. I like to share my expertise with others. Be it in a form of workshops, meetups or simple one-on-one mentoring. I know that knowledge sharing is essential for my own success and the success of Applifting. It is invaluable to have a competent colleague that can cover your back in a time of need.
