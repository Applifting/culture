## How to manage conflicts with a colleague?

The goal of this guide is to help you manage conflict situations between you and other Applifters.

The Applifter's Codex says that solving conflicts is an essential element in any organization. It is therefore important you know how to deal with a conflict so as to minimize its toxicity for both you and your colleague and so that your actions lead to a successful conflict denouement.

Below, a procedure is recommended on how to solve conflicts so that we all feel comfortable here. Obviously, no two conflicts are the same and each one has to be dealt with a little differently. Should you be at a loss, go ask the Council of Elders for help. 

## Preparation

Before you start handling a conflict with a colleague, it is desirable you clear a couple of things out in your head or on paper.

**The goal of the preparation is not to have as much material as possible to knock your opponent out with arguments.** Instead, the goal is to be able to look at the problematics from different angles, put yourself in your colleague's shoes and understand their motivation and behavior.

- What is the point of the conflict, devoid of emotions? How can you describe the problem matter-of-factly?
- In what way is your colleague going to view the point of the conflict?
- What emotions are you experiencing? How do you feel?
- What emotions is your colleague likely to be experiencing?
- What was your colleague's motivation? Why did he act the way he did?

## Before the conflict

First, check the facts. The perception of a conflict can often be caused by misunderstanding the other. Make sure that your understanding of the situation corresponds to that of your colleague.

If a lot of negative emotions are involved prior to the confrontation, try to temper them first.

Things that can help you with that:

* Sit down in a quiet room for five minutes and meditate on your colleague. Concentrate on their positive personality traits and the nice things you have been through together. Realize that you are likely to laugh off the upcoming conflict over a pint or two together in about half a year.
* Go work on something else for a while. Do something that makes you happy and that will renew your faith in people's goodwill.
* Any other method. After all, we are all different and who knows you better than yourself?

## Initiating the conflict

Stop your colleague in private and ask them if they have some time for you. Tell them you mean to discuss some tension between you two (feel free to use a friendlier or more humorous tone). If they do not have time right away, arrange a meeting that suits both parties.

In case your colleague refuses to handle the conflict with you in private, arrange a mediator's help right away.

## Group conflict

A situation may arise in which a whole group is in conflict with a colleague. This situation is especially tricky when it comes to a correct solution and it is particularly uncomfortable for the colleague in question. That is why you should abide by the following rules:

* If you are handling a personal conflict with a colleague, do not get others involved.
* Do not discuss problems behind your colleague's back.
* Take the confronted colleague's position under consideration; should you handle conflict under pressure, the solution may prove to be ineffective.

A chosen representative should initiate the conflict and they should inform the confronted colleague that a group conflict is being dealt with.

In case of a group conflict it is necessary to initiate the solution with the help of a mediator.

The conflict is then handled with the whole group participating.

## Handling conflict

Deal with a conflict at a private place and when both parties have enough time.

Proceed in accordance with the following points. Ask your colleague to listen and to not interrupt you.

1. **This is what happened / This is what is happening** => Describe the point of conflict, without emotions.
2. **This is the way it makes me feel** => Describe the emotional impact the conflict has on you. Try to regulate your emotions so that the other can handle them.
3. **Why do I think it is / was wrong** => Let your colleague know why their behavior was, in your eyes, wrong (unless it is crystal clear).
4. **I need this to happen / change** => Describe the expected change in your colleague's behavior / approach.

Now it is your turn to ask questions, stop interrupting and listen to your colleague. Suppress your ego and try to understand them.

1. **What do you think happened / is happening?** => Ask your colleague about their view of the point of the conflict.
2. **How does it make you feel?** => Ask your colleague about emotions the whole situation brings them.
3. **If you disagree with me, why do you think it is / was right?** => Ask your colleague why they think their conduct was right. Try to put yourself in their shoes and understand where they are coming from.
4. **What do you need me to do / change?** => Ask your colleague what they need from you in order to comply with your wishes.

Come up with the next steps together.

Express your respect and thank your colleague for their goodwill and courage to handle the conflict honestly and openly.

Do not forget that a conflict is a private matter. Unless you reach a different agreement, your meeting is confidential.

Consider arranging a retrospective meeting sometime in the future. You can check whether things are going according to your expectations there.
